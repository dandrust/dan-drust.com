Taking inspiration from [this list of challenging projects](web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/challengingprojects.html) and in an effort to learn C#, I'm writing a basic text editor as a C# console application. <!--more--> Goals for the project are:

* Build a cohesive project in C#
* Focus on learning C# and static typing
* Explore data structures appropriate for a text editor
* Use concepts from [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164) where appropriate
