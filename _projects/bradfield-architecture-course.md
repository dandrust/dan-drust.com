I'm taking the Computer Architecture course at [Bradfield CS](https://bradfieldcs.com/). <!--more--> Bradfield's courses are ideal for self-taught learners and bootcamp grads who want to fill in some CS fundamentals.  My goals for the course are:

* Understand the hardware/software interface
* Build a better mental model of computer hardware as it relates to software engineering
* Network with other developers in a simliar position
* Decide whether or not I would enjoy Bradfield's [Computer Science Intensive](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/) course

### Course Deliverables
* Simple virtual machine imlpementation in Ruby ([GitHub](https://github.com/dandrust/virtual_machine))
* Recursive Fibonacci calculator in MIPS assembly ([GitHub](https://github.com/dandrust/fibonacci-mips))
* Binary converter in MIPS assembly ([GitHub](https://github.com/dandrust/binary-converter-mips))
